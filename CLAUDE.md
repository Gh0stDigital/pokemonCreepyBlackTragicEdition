# Pokémon Creepy Black — Tragic Edition (Mu overhaul)

Binary ROM hack of the 1 MiB Game Boy ROM "Pokémon Black (Creepy)". Every version is built by a
Python script that applies **logged patches with old-byte asserts** on top of the previous verified ROM.
Never overwrite an earlier ROM; build a new version (v6, v7, …) and keep ROM length exactly 1,048,576 bytes.

## Layout
- `Creepy_Black_Mu_v1.gb` … `v5.gb` (root and `overhaul/`): builds. Latest = **v5**
  (SHA-256 ad5cac221a706237436afa9be82e3c64ae9db931384d764d588b147846b4a1a0).
- `edit/`: original v1 handoff (v1 build.py, which needs the clean base ROM that is NOT in this repo).
- `overhaul/build_v2.py … build_v5.py`: each takes the previous version, checks its SHA, writes the next
  ROM + `manifest_vN.json` (before/after bytes per patch). READMEs: `README_v2.txt`, `README_v3.txt`.
- `overhaul/harness.py` + `t*.py`: PyBoy emulator tests. `run_all.sh` (v2 features), `run_v3.sh` (full chain
  including the Mirage tests). Tests chain through save states in `overhaul/qa/` (gitignored; the chain
  regenerates them starting at `t1_opening.py`). Select the ROM with `CB_ROM=Creepy_Black_Mu_v5.gb`.
- `ref/`: reverse-engineering helpers. `red.gb` = vanilla Pokémon Red (US) for signature matching;
  `pokered.sym` = pret pokered symbols; `sig.py` locates vanilla routines in this ROM by masked byte
  signatures; `dis.py` = tiny disassembler (`python ref/dis.py ROM BANK ADDR N`); `pic.py` = Gen-1 pic
  (de)compressor.
- `pokeblack/charmap.asm`: pret pokered charmap (used by build text encoding and tests).

## Setup
`pip install pyboy pillow pypng`, then run from `overhaul/` with `PY=python bash run_v3.sh`
(scripts default to a Windows venv path; set `PY`). Set `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8`.

## Rules learned the hard way
- Verify bank, CPU address and file offset before patching; pokered addresses are shifted in this ROM.
- Text lines ≤ 17 rendered chars (`#` renders as "POKé", 4 chars): the ▼ arrow eats column 18.
- Outdoor maps can only show sprites in their sprite set (Pallet = set 1 at 0x17AB9).
- Don't claim behavior works until a PyBoy test shows it.

## Saved RAM used by the overhaul (D450–D4AD cleared on NEW GAME)
D450 Mu answer (1 Trainer, 2 Pokémon) · D451 Ghost acquired · D452 Curse used this battle · D453 trainer
killed by Curse · D454 Mu state · D455 Ghost hunger · D456 hunger step counter · D457–D45A temp ·
D45B police alert shown this map · D45C Ghost-use counter · D45D Mirage battle active · D45E alive mask ·
D45F Ghost deposited for Mirage. Do not use D485–D4A3 (real game data) or D4A4–D4AF (gravestones etc.).

## Features (see READMEs for verified details)
v1 Oak briefing, Mr. Mu question, shaman, Ghost after rival · v2 sprites (Gentleman/Channeler), Ghost hunger
(drain, eat party, permadeath wipe), Curse frightened text, police bulletin, text fixes · v3 Mirage Black Tamer
(silhouette trainer class 13, Lv50 Fossil Kabutops/Aerodactyl, MACABREBLADE/BLACK FLAME, Ghost to PC,
player stand-in species 0x79, 65% run, permanent deaths) · v4/v5 fossil back sprites (v5 = fossilized
originals).
